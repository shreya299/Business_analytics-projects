# üõ£Ô∏è New York Motor Vehicle Accident Analysis (2017‚Äì2021)

This project presents an analytical Power BI dashboard created using official crash data from the **New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**.  
It visualizes and compares accident trends across multiple years (2017‚Äì2021), highlighting **causes, contributing factors, directions, and vehicle types** involved in reported crashes.

## üìà Visual Analysis Summary
### 1. **Accidents Reported**
- Clear upward trend from 2017‚Äì2019, followed by a decline during 2020 (pandemic effect).
- 2021 numbers begin to recover but remain below pre-pandemic peak.

### 2. **Actions Performed**
- Straight-ahead driving dominates crash scenarios (nearly half of all cases).  
- Turning and lane-changing actions show smaller yet notable contributions.

### 3. **Causes**
- Human-related errors contribute most, followed by environmental and vehicle factors.  
- Frequent causes include collisions with fixed objects, poor weather, and speeding.

### 4. **Registration State**
- The vast majority (89%) of vehicles were New York registered.  
- Neighboring states such as NJ and PA contributed marginally.

### 5. **Direction of Impact**
- Crashes are evenly distributed across directions but show clusters in the **north and northeast** sectors.

### 6. **Rate of Vehicle Type**
- Passenger cars have the highest involvement rate, followed by SUVs and pickup trucks.
- Specialized vehicles (taxis, trailers, etc.) show minimal contribution.
